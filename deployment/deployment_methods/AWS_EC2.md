## 1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS

> Login to your AWS account from console.aws.amazon.com

### Create an EC2 instance
> 1. Search *EC2* in the search box in the top (or *Compute* in the list of services)
> 2. Click the `launch instance` button
> 3. Choose an AMI Image that match the need (i.e. Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS)
> 4. Choose an instance type that match the need (i.e. t3.medium)
> 5. Create a Key Pair (donâ€™t ignore) and download the .pem file (put it in your project folder, but don't share it!)
> 6. Review and click `Launch`

### Create a security group
> 1. Under `Network and Security / Security Groups`. Then Click `Create Security Group` to create one
> 2. Give it a name, then add Inboud & Outbount rules (type: All traffic | Source/Destination: 0.0.0.0:0)
> 3. Save
> 4. Under `Network and Security` tab, select `Network Interfaces`
> 5. Click on the instance and select `Change security groups`
> 6. Select the group we just created (basicgroup) and hit Save. 
> 7. If needed, start the instance (but it should already be running)


## 2. Connect to AWS EC2 instance using ssh

> 1. Under `EC2 / Instances` select your EC2 instance and click `Actions / connect`
> 2. Select `SSH client` tab
> 3. `cd to the project folder with the .pem file`
> 4. `chmod 400 my_key_pair.pem`

### Copy files to EC2 instance
> 1. `scp -r -i my_key_pair.pem ./API_client_server.py ubuntu@ec2-3-249-124-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/`
> 2. `scp -r -i my_key_pair.pem ./requirements.txt ubuntu@ec2-3-249-124-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/`
> 3. `scp -r -i my_key_pair.pem ./model1.pt ubuntu@ec2-3-249-124-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/`
> 4. etc.

### Connect the EC2 instance and run the project
> 1. ```ssh -i my_key_pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-249-124-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com```
> 2. (remote) `ls` (we should see the uploaded files)
> 3. (remote) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> 4. (remote) `python API_client_server.py`
> 5. Access the model using the public url (EC2/Instances) + the app port <br>(i.e. : http://ec2-3-249-124-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5000 )


## 3. Make it persistant

**Now the model should be running** and that's quite handy to make computations that can't be made on the local computer, but **if we disconnect the terminal the app will stop running!**

So in order to perenize this, we can use the following command:

> (remote) `screen -R deploy python API_client_server.py`

or using gunicorn (which is more appropriate for deployement)
> (remote) `screen -R deploy gunicorn API_client_server:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --timeout=60 --threads=2`

And hence the API server will keep running even if the terminal is closed.

But, next time you connect to the EC2 instance you won't see the API running and won't be able to stop it...
To solve this problem, you simply need to get the screen-instance back with the following command:
> (remote) `screen -r`

Then you can check the logs and / or stop the instance
> (remove) `CTRL+C` to stop the instance
